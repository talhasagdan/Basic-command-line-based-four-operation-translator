# Basic command line based four operation translator

Command line based translator words to operations with Java. 

__First part:__  Basic Java Solution

__Second part:__ Stack Solution

__Input__

The first line of the input contains an integer t. t test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line containing a string s. The string will consist of digits 0 to 9 and the words “plus”, “minus”, “times” and “tothepowerof”. There will always be at least one digit between operator strings. No number otherthan 0 will begin with 0.


__Output__

For each test case, print a line containing “Case #i: y” where y is the result of the computation given in s. In contrast to usual notation, all operations should be evaluated from left to right.

__Constraints__

• 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.

• s will have at least 1 and at most 1000 characters.

• y and all intermediate results will be between −10 and 10 .

• All numbers appearing in s will be between 0 and 109 (inclusive).
